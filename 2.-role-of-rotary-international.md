# 2. Role of Rotary International

Rotary International supports districts that participate in Rotary Youth Exchange by:

* Administering a district certification program \(see more about the certification process below\)
* Providing guidance and ensuring compliance with Rotary policies
* Helping them communicate with their partners abroad and

  responding to program inquiries from Rotarians and the general

  public

* Developing resources for networking, communicating, and

  promoting the Youth Exchange program, such as the Youth Exchange Officers directory, Youth Exchange newsletter, and branded promotional materials available in the Rotary Brand Center and on Shop Rotary

  This chapter describes the role of the Rotary International Secretariat in the Youth Exchange program.

## District Certification Program

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only districts that meet the following requirements and maintain official certification from Rotary International may participate in Youth Exchange.
{% endhint %}

### Minimum Requirements for Certification

These requirements apply to both short- and long-term exchanges, unless otherwise indicated within the Youth Exchange section of the Rotary Code of Policies:

* [ ] **INCORPORATION AND LIABILITY INSURANCE**

  * Establish a corporation or similar formal legal entity that includes the district Youth Exchange program.
  * Secure adequate liability insurance with coverage and limits appropriate for the region where the district is located.
  * Ensure each inbound student has a travel insurance policy that meets Rotary’s minimum requirements, explained in chapter 4. The parents or legal guardians of the student are responsible for the payment of all insurance and associated costs.

* [ ] **YOUTH PROTECTION AND SAFETY**

  * Develop and enforce a district youth protection policy, including guidelines for reporting allegations. Read the Rotary Youth Protection Guide for youth protection requirements and to see a sample district youth protection policy.
  * Conduct a thorough screening of all Rotarian and non-Rotarian volunteers including having them complete an application, criminal background check, reference check, and in-person interview. Host families must also meet these requirements, as well as receive announced and unannounced \(or short-notice\) home visits from a Youth Exchange officer.
  * Conduct a thorough screening of student applicants including having them complete an application and in-person interview.  At least one of the student’s parents or legal guardians must attend the interview.
  * Provide mandatory orientation sessions that cover program  rules and abuse prevention and awareness training: one for students going abroad and their parents or legal guardians prior to departure, and another for students you host upon their arrival.
  * Supply students with contact information for club- and district- level individuals who can support the student during the exchange. Include emergency service and local medical information, as well as a 24-hour emergency district “hotline” number.
  * Establish a procedure for moving a student into a temporary, pre-screened host family in case of an allegation against a host family member.
  * Report all serious incidents and allegations of abuse and harassment to Rotary Youth Exchange staff within 72 hours.

* [ ] **COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING**

  * Develop a process to ensure all participating clubs and volunteers within the district comply with Rotary’s certification requirements.
  * Implement a document retention policy for student, volunteer, and host family applications and materials related to Youth Exchange, including records of student incidents and individuals who are prohibited from participating in Rotary youth programs.
  * Make sure the district is sending students abroad to a district that is certified by Rotary International to participate in the Youth Exchange program.

* [ ] **PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING**
  * Train all Rotarian and non-Rotarian volunteers.
  * Select a Rotarian counselor to support the exchange student \(find

    more information on this role in [chapter 3](3.-building-a-successful-youth-exchange-program/)\). This individual must receive specialized training on how to deal with issues of sexual abuse and harassment, and may not be a member of the student’s host family.

  * Make sure all long-term hosting is voluntary and that long-term exchange students have more than one host family.

A district must submit to RI proof of minimum certification requirements. RI staff will review the documents and inform district leaders about  
 their certification status. Districts cannot plan or arrange any exchanges until their district’s certification status is confirmed by letter. To start the certification process and obtain the certification form, email [youthexchange@rotary.org](mailto:youthexchange@rotary.org)

{% hint style="info" %}
**PARTICIPATION BY NONCERTIFIED DISTRICTS IS PROHIBITED**

Only certified districts may participate in the Rotary Youth Exchange program. Planning or arranging exchanges with noncertified districts is prohibited and could result in decertification, with a possible suspension of participation in future Youth Exchange activities.
{% endhint %}

### Certification Renewal

Every year, the district must renew its certification to prove that it still meets RI’s requirements for participating in the program. In May, Rotary will send the incoming district governor and incoming district Youth Exchange chair a certification renewal form to sign and return confirming their district’s compliance.

### Recertification

Every five to seven years, Rotary conducts an in-depth review of the district’s compliance with certification requirements. The following documents must be submitted to Rotary for recertification: proof of status as a legal entity, proof of liability insurance, and the district’s youth protection policy.

### Special Case District Certifications

#### **OUTBOUND-ONLY CERTIFICATION**

Outbound-only \(one-way\) certification allows the district to send students but not host them. The outbound-only certification process is simpler than traditional certification.

#### MULTINATIONAL DISTRICT CERTIFICATION

Districts that encompass multiple countries, referred to as multinational districts, must verify that certification requirements are met in each country that plans to participate in the Youth Exchange program. Multinational districts can apply for certification for select countries within the district or the entirety of the district.

To learn more or to start the certification process, email [youthexchange@rotary.org](mailto:youthexchange@rotary.org).

## Youth Exchange Officers Preconvention Meeting

The Youth Exchange Officers Preconvention is held immediately before the annual Rotary International Convention. Join Youth Exchange leaders from around the world to share ideas, learn how to enhance your exchanges, and build lasting connections with Youth Exchange officers at the club, district, and multidistrict levels from around the world. Although the Youth Exchange Officers Preconvention is open to all convention attendees, including Youth Exchange students, the meeting content is designed for Youth Exchange officers. Plan now to attend the next Youth Exchange Officers Preconvention. Learn more.

## Youth Exchange Committee

The RI president often appoints a Youth Exchange Committee to advise Rotary International’s Board of Directors on all aspects of the program and to develop content for the Youth Exchange Officers Preconvention. Rotarians may contact members of this committee to request advice and share feedback. Email [youthexchange@rotary.org](mailto:youthexchange@rotary.org) for committee contact information.
