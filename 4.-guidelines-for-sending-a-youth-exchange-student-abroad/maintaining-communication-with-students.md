# Maintaining Communication With Students

Clubs and districts should communicate regularly with their students abroad during the exchange. Establish a reporting procedure with each student and ask students to email updates to their Rotarian counselor from their home club or a designated Rotarian at least once a quarter. Regular communication helps your district know how the student is adapting and be aware of any challenges a student may encounter. Make sure all students have an emergency contact in your district.

**GOOD TO KNOW**

Some families of students going abroad benefit from hosting inbound exchange students. Not only do parents or legal guardians gain a greater awareness of another culture, but they also have a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities their child may experience abroad. Hosting is at the discretion of the family and is not a requirement for their child to participate in the program.
