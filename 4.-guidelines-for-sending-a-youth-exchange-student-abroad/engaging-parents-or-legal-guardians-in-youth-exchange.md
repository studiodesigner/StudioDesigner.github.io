# Engaging Parents or Legal Guardians in Youth Exchange

Support from parents or legal guardians before, during, and after a student’s exchange creates a positive experience for the student and allows the parents or legal guardians to support the program’s goals.

## BEFORE THE EXCHANGE

It’s critical to include parents or legal guardians of outbound students in the selection and orientation process so they understand what’s expected of them and their child.

### EXPECTATIONS AND RULES

Explain the rules and regulations of your program and how they benefit the student. Require that both parents or legal guardians and the student agree to them in writing. Include the rules that apply to parents, such as travel or communication restrictions, as well as rules that apply to the student. By understanding the purpose of the rules and committing to abide by them, parents or legal guardians can support their child in upholding them.

### FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS

Costs for parents or legal guardians can vary by district and depend on scholarship offerings. The specific financial responsibilities for parents or legal guardians should be clearly outlined and agreed upon by both parties. Often parents or legal guardians pay all travel costs, including expenses for passports, visas, and travel insurance. Parents or legal guardians also cover any incidental expenses during the exchange for entertainment, snacks,

or souvenirs. Your district may require an emergency fund that can be refunded, in whole or in part if not needed, after the exchange is completed.

### STUDENT TRAVEL INSURANCE

The parent or legal guardian and the student are responsible for paying  
 all medical and accident costs, and providing travel insurance including medical and dental coverage for accidental injury and illness, death benefits \(including repatriation of remains\), disability/dismemberment benefits \(also known as capital benefits\), emergency medical evacuation, emergency visitation expenses, 24-hour emergency assistance services, and legal liability \(covering the student for any of his or her acts or omission in connection with the Youth Exchange program\), in line with Rotary’s minimum levels of coverage as outlined in the Rotary Code of Policies. Insurance to cover cancellation expenses, loss of property, loss of money, or kidnap and ransom can also be purchased at the parent’s discretion.

Because the host district must be able to provide immediate, emergency medical attention, coverage must be satisfactory to the host district, with coverage from the time the student leaves home until they return. Where it is a legal requirement for travel insurance to be purchased in the host country, such insurance must meet RI minimum levels of coverage. In all other cases, dual insurance should be avoided unless agreed to by all parties.

**TRAVEL SAFETY**

All students and their families should understand the risks that international travel poses. Government- issued travel warnings, alerts, and bans should be taken seriously. Students and parents should review their home country’s travel recommendations for their child’s host country prior to the exchange. If a student’s home embassy designates the host country as high risk, parents should work with their host and sending district to fully understand what this means. Local Rotarians can offer more updated information. Ultimately, parents are responsible for assessing risks and consenting to the exchange. If a student’s parents or legal guardians have continued concerns about safety, they should remove their child from the program.

Families should sign up for traveler notification programs through their local embassy. Should a large-scale emergency like a natural disaster, political unrest, or terrorism occur, the host district should remain in contact with the sending district, parents or guardians, and RI. Parents or guardians should, with their host and sending districts, assess the risks and agree to the student remaining in the host country or returning home. Should any one of these three parties be uncomfortable with continuing the exchange, an early return should be arranged as soon as it is safe to do so.

## DURING THE EXCHANGE

### STUDENT TRAVEL WHILE ON EXCHANGE

Many host districts and clubs offer students opportunities to travel  
 as part of their exchange. Travel arranged by the host club, district,  
 or multidistrict, such as orientation camps, district conferences, and other events, is considered customary and does not require the parent or legal guardian’s permission. For all other travel, including travel with the host family or tours outside the local community \(as defined by the host district\), the host district must obtain written permission from the parents or legal guardians and share details about the program, location of the event, travel itineraries, sleeping accommodations, and contact information.

### COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CHILD AND PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN

You should encourage regular but limited correspondence between parents or legal guardians and their child during the exchange. Help parents understand that too much communication can negatively impact their child’s ability to immerse themselves into the host community. It’s important to give the student some time to adjust to the new environment, overcome culture shock, and assimilate into their new surroundings.

### PARENTAL VISITS

Discourage parents or legal guardians from visiting their child during  
 the exchange. A visit can trigger or intensify homesickness and set back assimilation into the new culture. Emphasize that both the host district and club must approve any visit before it takes place. Should parents or legal guardians plan to visit, strongly recommend that they do so during the last two months of the exchange. They should never visit during holidays, as these celebrations offer a key cultural experience for the student and a chance for host families to involve the student in special events.

## STUDENT’S SCHEDULED RETURN AND AFTER THE EXCHANGE

### REVERSE CULTURE SHOCK

Reverse culture shock, which often includes difficulties adjusting and disorientation upon returning home, is a significant phase of the exchange experience. It’s important that parents or legal guardians understand and be prepared to manage this transition; while their lives may have remained essentially the same during the exchange, their child has likely experienced profound changes. By communicating regularly throughout the exchange, parents can have a better understanding of the student’s new experiences and help them readjust after they return.

One of the most common challenges for parents or legal guardians is coping with the student’s newfound independence. It’s not unusual for students  
 to find that the rules they lived under before the exchange now seem too restrictive. Being prepared for these changes will make it easier for families to respond positively.

### LIFE AFTER THE EXCHANGE

Rotarians from the sending district and club can help returning students adjust to life after the exchange by maintaining communication with them and their families. Involve students and their parents or legal guardians in Rotary activities, programs, and events. Hold debriefing meetings with returned students and their parents or legal guardians to learn how you can improve your program. Connect students with alumni associations made up of other returned students. Learn more about alumni associations in [chapter 6](../6.-staying-connected-as-alumni.md).
