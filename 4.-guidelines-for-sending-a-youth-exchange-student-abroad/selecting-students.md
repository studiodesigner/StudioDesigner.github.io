**DISTRICT GRANT FUNDING**

The Youth Exchange program is funded completely by Rotary districts and local Rotary clubs. You can use Rotary Foundation **district grants** to fund your youth programs, including Youth Exchange. A district grant can be used to fund scholarships for individual exchanges or for larger activities or events for groups of Youth Exchange students. Districts must be qualified before they can administer the funds, which, like other Rotary Foundation funds, cannot be used for the activities of lineal descendants of Rotarians. Global grants cannot be used to fund Youth Exchange. Learn more by emailing [grants@rotary.org](mailto:grants@rotary.org).

## DIVERSITY IN STUDENT SELECTION

Rotary clubs and districts are encouraged to consider students from all backgrounds and should strive to administer their program in a manner that avoids discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or gender identity, while not sacrificing student safety or comfort with the hosting arrangement. Because cultural norms and local laws differ around the world on these kinds of issues, adequate care should be taken to make sure that all parties involved approve of and are comfortable with the hosting arrangement.

Open communication between the student, parents or legal guardians, host family, and involved clubs and districts is important and helps the host district determine the best placement and environment for the student’s needs. Host families should be screened for compatibility with diverse populations in advance so suitable placements may be made, creating a positive experience for all involved.

## ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

Rotary clubs and districts are encouraged to consider students with physical or mental health conditions as potential participants. Many past exchanges involving students with disabilities have proven successful and beneficial to all involved. Clear communication between the student, parents or legal guardians, host family, and involved clubs and districts regarding the needs of the student can prepare all parties for a safe and rewarding experience.

All parties should agree to the level of accommodations provided during the student’s stay. Host districts should determine whether they can provide the necessary accommodations, and communicate that with the student’s home district as well as the student’s parents or legal guardians.

## APPLICATION AND INTERVIEW PROCESS

1. Require students to complete an application form that includes a statement of compliance with program rules. Many clubs and districts distribute a short prescreening form to narrow the field of applicants before requesting a completed long application. For samples of commonly used application forms developed by Youth Exchange officers, email [youthexchange@rotary.org](mailto:youthexchange@rotary.org).
2. Hold in-person interviews with both applicants and their parents or legal guardians. These should include at least one interview by a sending club, in addition to interviews by district representatives. Discussion topics should include:

   * Purpose of an exchange and program expectations
   * Student’s motivation for participating in a Rotary Youth Exchange
   * How the student feels about spending time away from home, family,and friends
   * Program rules
   * Awareness of world news and issues
   * Serving as an ambassador for their home city, country, and Rotary club
   * Parental custody or legal guardianship of the student and other special considerations regarding the student

   Other interview activities might include asking the student to give a short presentation about themselves and arranging an informal question-and-answer session with Youth Exchange alumni, families of alumni, local school administrators, or others involved in the program.

3. After reviewing applications and conducting interviews, select students based on these criteria:

* Maturity level
* Ability to exercise good judgment
* Compatibility with goals of Rotary’s program
* The ability of participating districts to effectively accommodate any physical or mental health needs that are identified
* Number of students that the sending and host districts can support
  * It’s better to send fewer students on exchange than to send students who aren’t qualified or who may struggle during their time abroad.
  * If more qualified candidates apply than your program can support, select alternates in the event a selected student is unable to participate.

## FINAL ACCEPTANCE

After students have been selected and the district has confirmed their participation, notify students and their parents or legal guardians in writing. Outline any contingencies \(for example, participation in orientation meetings or payment of fees\) before final acceptance, and include a date when the host country will be confirmed. Students should be aware that their participation in the exchange is not guaranteed until departure and is conditional based on completed attendance of all student orientations and adherence to club and district rules.
