# 4. Guidelines for Sending a Youth Exchange Student Abroad

As a Rotarian sending students abroad, you can promote Youth Exchange to prospective students, select suitable candidates, place students with host districts, and plan an orientation for students and their families. During the exchange, you should maintain contact with the students abroad to ensure a successful experience and provide them with guidance and support. When students return home from their exchange, you play an important role by helping them and their families adjust to life after the exchange and encouraging a continued connection to Rotary through alumni and other youth program opportunities.
