# Placing Students With Host Districts

After your district Youth Exchange committee selects students to go abroad — based both on students’ qualifications and the anticipated number of placements — use your Youth Exchange network to find districts to host the students.

## CONNECT WITH OTHER DISTRICTS

Many districts have established longstanding exchange relationships  
 that facilitate more efficient placements of students and strengthen the support system available to students during their exchange. If your district hasn’t established exchange relationships or would like to develop new partnerships, Rotary International’s directory of Youth Exchange district chairs and multidistrict officers can help you locate the appropriate contact for the district or the country where you’d like to place students. Rotary International emails this directory to Youth Exchange chairs, officers,  
 and contacts quarterly; people with these positions can also access the most recent directory in their My Rotary account. It is your responsibility to confirm that the host district is certified to participate. Email youthexchange@rotary.org if you have any questions about certification status or need to access the directory.

## MAKE IT OFFICIAL

Once you’ve located a placement for a student, have the Youth Exchange officers in the participating districts and clubs, the student, and the student’s parents or legal guardians sign a written agreement. Make sure the agreement includes the districts’ expectations about the exchange, including but not limited to:

* Length of the exchange
* Number of host families
* Student selection and orientation
* Contacts, including emergency and support services
* Student fees and stipends
* Behavioral expectations and potential disciplinary actions

Communication throughout the process is key to a successful exchange. Inform all participants of the student’s travel plans and arrival date. Ask the host district about plans for meeting the student at the airport and helping them settle in with their first host family. Request confirmation from the hosting district that the student has arrived safely.

**IMPORTANT**!

Abuse and harassment awareness and prevention training in orientation is required for all students and their parents or legal guardians in order for the district to maintain certification and participate in Youth Exchange.
