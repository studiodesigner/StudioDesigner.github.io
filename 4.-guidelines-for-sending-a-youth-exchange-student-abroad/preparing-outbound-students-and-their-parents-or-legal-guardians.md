# Preparing Outbound Students and Their Parents or Legal Guardians

Orientation programs vary widely from one club or district to another but should include the core topics outlined below. Districts that are part of a multidistrict group can benefit by participating in larger-scale orientation programs.

Preparing students for the exchange experience should be an ongoing process that includes weekend gatherings and shorter meetings during the year before departure. Give students reading materials about their host country and encourage them to do their own research. This gradual and relaxed process gives students a chance to absorb and react to a large amount of information.

Orientation sessions also give you the chance to make sure the student is ready for a Youth Exchange by seeing how they react to information presented in the sessions and interact with their peers and Rotarians.

Invite Youth Exchange alumni to participate in orientation; peers can provide valuable insight. Allocate enough time for students to talk with alumni so they have a better understanding of the exchange experience. If possible, include current inbound exchange students in the orientation.

**TRAVEL SAFETY**

All students and their families should understand the risks that international travel poses. Government- issued travel warnings, alerts, and bans should be taken seriously. Students and parents should review their home country’s travel recommendations for their child’s host country prior to the exchange. If a student’s home embassy designates the host country as high risk, parents should work with their host and sending district to fully understand what this means. Local Rotarians can offer more updated information. Ultimately, parents are responsible for assessing risks and consenting to the exchange. If a student’s parents or legal guardians have continued concerns about safety, they should remove their child from the program.

Families should sign up for traveler notification programs through their local embassy. Should a large-scale emergency like a natural disaster, political unrest, or terrorism occur, the host district should remain in contact with the sending district, parents or guardians, and RI. Parents or guardians should, with their host and sending districts, assess the risks and agree to the student remaining in the host country or returning home. Should any one of these three parties be uncomfortable with continuing the exchange, an early return should be arranged as soon as it is safe to do so.
