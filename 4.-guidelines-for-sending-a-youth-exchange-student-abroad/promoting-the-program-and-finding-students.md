# Promoting the Program and Finding Students

Promoting your program to a wide range of young people will help you find suitable candidates for exchanges. Start by inviting current and past participants of Rotary’s other youth programs, such as **Interact** and **RYLA**, to apply. They know Rotary, possess strong leadership skills, and are dedicated to increasing global awareness — ideal characteristics for representing Rotary and their country through Youth Exchange.

Expand your audience by creating a district Youth Exchange website to promote the program. Share Youth Exchange stories and opportunities through your club and district social media accounts. Post photos of participants \(with their permission\) having fun, exploring their host countries, and meeting new people.

You can also distribute promotional materials at schools, libraries, community and athletic centers, and other places where young people gather \(be sure to ask for permission from school and community administrators\). Highlight the cultural, professional, and educational benefits of Youth Exchange, as well as Rotary’s commitment to youth protection and its strong network of community leaders. Involve club members who work in public relations, marketing, and advertising to help create professional-looking brochures and flyers.
