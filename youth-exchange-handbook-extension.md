# 1. Introduction to Rotary Youth Exchange

Rotary clubs channel their commitment to service at home and abroad through five Avenues of Service, which are the foundation of club activity. Youth Service, one of the five, recognizes the importance of empowering youth through leadership development programs. Rotary Youth Exchange is one of many youth leadership development programs offered by Rotary.

Living in a foreign country is a powerful way to gain global understanding and promote peace. Through Youth Exchange, students learn a new language, discover different cultures and customs, and make friendships that last a lifetime.

The objectives of the Rotary Youth Exchange program include:

* Instilling international understanding and goodwill in students
* Creating positive change by empowering youth
* Making lasting connections for host clubs, host families communities, and the students involved

Rotary districts administer the Youth Exchange program in collaboration with local Rotary clubs. A Rotary district is a group of Rotary clubs in a specific area or region. Rotary has approximately 530 districts worldwide. Unlike many exchange programs, Rotary Youth Exchange is managed by volunteers, resulting in relatively low administrative costs and a strong support network of engaged Rotarians. Rotaryâ€™s youth protection policies and district Youth Exchange certification program ensure that the safety of our youth is the highest priority.



### Types of Exchanges

Rotary districts can choose to conduct long-term exchanges, short-term exchanges, or both. Exchanges are typically open to students ages 15 to 19, but districts determine the exact age ranges. Flexibility in the Youth Exchange program allows it to be adapted to fit the needs of any student who qualifies.

**Long-term exchanges** usually last one academic year, during which the student lives with multiple families in the host country and is required to attend school.

**Short-term exchanges** last from a few days to several months, often take place when school is not in session, and vary widely among districts. Participants typically stay with a local family in the host country, but they might also attend a youth camp or tour the country with students from around the world.

Both programs need to meet the certification requirements. Most of the information in this handbook applies to the long-term exchange program, which has additional program elements.
