# 6. Staying Connected as Alumni

The Rotary experience doesn’t have to end when students return home from their exchange. Students who return from their exchange are considered Rotary alumni and forever remain a part of the Rotary family. As Youth Exchange alumni return home, Rotarians from the sending district should make an effort to welcome them back and help them find ways to continue to benefit from Rotary’s programs and contribute to Rotary service.

### WELCOME ALUMNI BACK

* Youth Exchange alumni are often brimming with excitement and eager to talk about their experiences when they return home from their travels abroad. Invite alumni to speak about their trip at club meetings throughout the district. Not only can this motivate other Rotarians to become involved in Youth Exchange, it also helps alumni build connections throughout your district.
* Hold a welcome party for all returning Youth Exchange students. Invite other alumni, including other Youth Exchange alumni and alumni from other Rotary programs. Events like this help new Youth Exchange alumni build their personal and professional networks by fostering introductions to people who have shared similar experiences.

### MENTOR ALUMNI

* Alumni will look to you to help them understand their next steps in Rotary. Continue to meet with returning students to understand their hopes for the future and how Rotary can be a part.
* Help them find or start local Interact or Rotaract clubs so they can continue their Rotary service.
* If returning students intend to travel elsewhere after their Youth Exchange, introduce them to Rotarians in other Rotary districts where they’ll be travelling. Take advantage of your own Rotary networks to make their transition to a new city easier.

**ROTEX ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS**

Rotary alumni associations are groups of former program participants, often based in a district or geographic region, that offer opportunities for alumni to meet socially and professionally and stay connected to Rotary. Alumni associations for former Youth Exchange participants are called Rotex. When Rotex groups are well organized, they play a major role in mentoring current exchange students. Some also coordinate sightseeing trips for exchange students being hosted in their districts and lead orientations for sending and welcoming students. Rotex groups also frequently support Rotary service projects or undertake their own.

### SUPPORT AN ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

* Help alumni find or start a local Rotex or Rotary alumni association in which they can continue to network with others who have shared similar experiences.

### CONNECT WITH OTHER DISTRICT LEADERS

* Many Rotarians in your district may have experience working with alumni of both Youth Exchange and other Rotary programs. They can share their best practices for engaging alumni.
* Your local district alumni chair can help provide access to a wider world of alumni of all ages and from all Rotary programs.
* Your local Rotaract or Interact chair can help you understand how to be involved in these types of clubs as a next step in one’s Rotary career.
* A scholarship or grants chair can help returning students understand how Rotary can fund future education or support their ideas for local or international service.
