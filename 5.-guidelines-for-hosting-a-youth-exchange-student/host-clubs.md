# Host Clubs

The district Youth Exchange committee should work with the governor and assistant governors to identify clubs that are interested in the program and have the capacity to support an inbound student. District committee members should provide clubs with realistic expectations of the time and financial commitment that a club assumes when hosting a student. Learn more about the host club responsibilities in chapter 3.
