# Host Families

## FINDING HOST FAMILIES

Long-term exchange students must have more than one host family — preferably three different families — during their exchange. By living in the homes of several families, students are exposed to a variety of experiences in the host country and better understand the culture as a whole. While

it may not be possible to secure all three host families before the student arrives, be sure to identify a temporary backup host family in advance.

A host family should be responsible, willing, and interested in welcoming a young person from another country into their home. Host families  
 do not need to be Rotarian families; in fact, community members often become interested in joining Rotary because of their involvement in Youth Exchange. You can find host families using the same methods you used to advertise the program to potential students. To protect the student’s privacy, do not use personally identifiable information about the student in your public promotions. In some cases, this may be prohibited by local law.

Suggestions for finding prospective host families:

* Encourage Rotarians to host students. Invite current inbound

  students to club meetings so members can hear, firsthand, about

  their experiences with host families.

* Ask Rotarians to recommend non-Rotarian families they feel are

  qualified and may be interested in hosting a Youth Exchange student.

* Ask families who have successfully hosted students to recommend

  other families in the community who might be interested in hosting.

* Ask the families of Youth Exchange alumni to act as hosts. They

  may appreciate the chance to take part in the program because of

  the opportunity it provided to their own children.

* Ask Youth Exchange alumni for the names of families they feel

  would make good host parents.

* Make a presentation about the Youth Exchange program to parent

  and community associations. Highlight the benefits of hosting and

  follow up with all who express interest.

* Keep in contact with Youth Exchange alumni; they may make

  excellent host families and future Rotarians.

## SELECTING HOST FAMILIES

Share information about the program and distribute your district’s host family application to families that express interest in hosting. When reviewing applications and interviewing prospective hosts, look for responsible, willing families. Identify a variety of families, including some with younger children, some with children around the age of the student, and some with no children in the home. Single parents, same-sex couples, and retirees can all make excellent hosts.

Do not settle for families who are only willing to provide room and board — seek out those who will actively enhance the exchange experience by involving students in many different community activities.

## EFFECTIVE HOSTS

The most effective host families are:

* Caring and respectful with each other
* Flexible and able to adapt to having someone new in the home
* Good humored and able to put a problem or situation into perspective
* Patient and willing to work through common misunderstandings
* Willing to engage in different activities and visit places outside the home
* Interested in a variety of topics of conversation, culture, and recreation

## SCREENING HOST FAMILIES

To protect students and promote a positive exchange experience, it’s essential to thoroughly screen prospective host families. Clearly outline program rules and expectations and evaluate the potential host families’ reasons for wanting to host. All host families must complete and sign your district’s application form, adhere to the rules of the exchange, and give authorization for your district to conduct a background check or review law enforcement public record checks. Criminal background checks, including law enforcement public record checks and reference checks, must be done for all adult members of the host family.

## HOST FAMILY HOME VISITS

Before selecting host families, a district or club leader must visit applicants in their home at a time when all family members who live in the home are present. During the visit, review the host family’s responsibilities and give them additional club or district materials about the hosting experience. Confirm their commitment to attend required orientation and training sessions and to help their exchange student attend required Rotary activities. Both scheduled and unannounced or short-notice home visits should be made before and during the exchange.

When screening host families and visiting homes, ask the following questions:

* Why is the family interested in hosting an exchange student?
* What experience do family members have with different cultures? This could include travel abroad, professional experience, knowledge of foreign languages, and other experiences.
* What are the planned sleeping arrangements for the student? The student must have his or her own bed. If it is necessary for the student to share a room with a host sibling, it must be with one who identifies with the same gender and is preferably of similar age.
* Would they provide appropriate supervision and take on parental responsibility to ensure the student’s well-being?
* How would the family incorporate an exchange student into their daily life?
* Would chores be assigned to the student? If so, what types of chores? • What activities would the family plan to help a young person get to know their host community and country better?
* How would the student get to school and other extracurricular activities?
* How would the host parents handle difficult situations with the student, such as language and communication challenges, discipline and emotional issues, and culture shock?



Additionally, observe the home environment and consider:

* What is the general condition of the home? Is it clean with adequate light, heat, and other necessities?
* Does the family have the necessary resources to host a student, such as adequate space and time?
* Is it likely that a student would be physically and emotionally safe in the home?

## PLACING STUDENTS WITH HOST FAMILIES

Once a host family has met all screening and training requirements, they can be matched with an exchange student. Host families must receive training that includes information on program administration and rules, as well as abuse and harassment awareness and prevention. In making a good match for both students and families, consider:

* Similar interests \(recreation, hobbies, sports, and cultural activities\)
* The ages of any host siblings
* Personalities and values of all the parties

It’s best to place students with their first host family immediately upon arrival in their host country rather than making a temporary placement. This helps smooth the transition to the student’s new home.

Host families are essential to the program, and Rotarians in the host club should work to maintain a positive relationship with the families. Invite them to club events and show appreciation in person and through written thank-you notes. Suggest creating a host family networking group that can meet monthly to share ideas and experiences. Following an exchange, ask families to complete an evaluation form. Cultivating an open and positive relationship with host families increases the possibility that they will want to host students in the future or perhaps even become Rotarians.

Occasionally, a host family situation does not work, and the student must be moved. All hosting programs should have at least one prescreened host family available to accept a student in an emergency or on a temporary basis. Try to find an experienced host family that is skilled in problem solving and working with youth in crisis situations.
