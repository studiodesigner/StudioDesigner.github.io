# Managing Early Returns

Exchange students can and do return home early for a variety of reasons; all participating districts should be prepared to handle early returns. Some leave because of homesickness, illness, or issues back home. Others are sent home because of problems that occur in the host country during the exchange. A student can be sent home for violating a district Youth Exchange program rule, geopolitical crises, or other health and safety issues that may arise during the exchange.

Outlining the district’s program rules and potential disciplinary actions  
 up to and including an early return will help ensure all parties are in agreement and avoid conflicts or ambiguity in actions taken should the student violate any program rules. Not all violations of the rules should warrant an immediate early return. Use of an exchange agreement can help provide a written understanding between all parties. Care should be taken to apply program rules consistently to avoid perceptions of unfairness.

Early returns should be managed delicately and always with the full knowledge of the sending club and district and the student’s parents or legal guardians. While host districts have authority over a decision to send a student home early, whatever the cause of the early return, do not send a student home until both the hosting and sending district agree to specific travel arrangements and the student’s parents or legal guardians have been notified. When the sending and hosting districts disagree about an early return, district governors should be notified and assist in mediation.

**STUDENTS AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITY**

If a student is a witness to or victim of a crime, the decision to return early or stay should be left to the student and his or her parents or guardians. This choice is especially important for victims of sexual abuse or harassment, who may feel that being sent home early from the exchange is a punishment for reporting. If a student elects to return home, confirm with local law enforcement that he or she isn’t needed in the host country as a witness before making travel arrangements. If a student is accused of a crime, local law enforcement will determine if and when the student can leave the country.

When faced with an early return of an inbound student, the host district should take the following steps:

1. Discuss the situation with the student and the Rotarian counselor.
2. Contact your counterpart in the sending district, and explain the reasons the student is being sent home. If you are corresponding by email, copy any relevant multidistrict groups on the communication.
3. Allow the student to contact his or her parents or legal guardians, and work with the sending district to facilitate communication with them as well.
4. Work with the sending district contact and the parents or legal guardians to arrange an acceptable return travel itinerary.
5. Help the student make departure arrangements and facilitate farewells with the host family and school friends.
6. If there are concerns over the student’s safety or health, consult local law enforcement or medical professionals to determine when it is safe for the student to return home. Make additional arrangements for the student’s return trip, such as a medical chaperone, if necessary.
7. Notify relevant government and insurance agencies about visa and student travel insurance status.
8. Notify the district governor and Rotary Youth Exchange staff within 72 hours in writing that a student is being sent home. Include the name of the student, sending district, date of return, and reasons for return.
