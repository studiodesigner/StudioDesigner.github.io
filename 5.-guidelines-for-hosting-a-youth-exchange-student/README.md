# 5. Guidelines for Hosting a Youth Exchange Student

Hosting a Youth Exchange student offers Rotarians and local residents the opportunity to experience another culture within their own community. Local students and community members can contribute  
 to the exchange experience. The rewards for all involved are great, but hosting a student requires a significant time commitment for Rotarians in the host club and district.

To arrange for the best exchange experience possible, the host club and district are responsible for:

* Screening and selecting host families
* Assigning Rotarian counselors
* Coordinating inbound orientation
* Developing an effective support system

## Host Clubs

The district Youth Exchange committee should work with the governor and assistant governors to identify clubs that are interested in the program and have the capacity to support an inbound student. District committee members should provide clubs with realistic expectations of the time and financial commitment that a club assumes when hosting a student. Learn more about the host club responsibilities in chapter 3.
