# Communicating With Students Before Arrival



Once inbound students have been assigned to counselors and host families, send the following welcome and orientation materials:

* General schedule of the exchange year, including district meetings, outings, travel opportunities, and other activities
* Name and contact information for the first host family
* Name and contact information for the Rotarian counselor
* General information about the community and country \(local

  geography, history, government\) and the culture \(colloquial phrases, meaning of certain gestures, customary greetings, holiday traditions, social customs, religious beliefs and practices\)

* Practical information about climate, clothing, and school
* District rules, student travel insurance requirements, student fees

  and stipends, and emergency fund amounts

* Expectations about speaking engagements at clubs

In addition, the host club and district should help inbound students obtain visas, make arrangements for meeting them at the airport, and coordinate any enrollment and tuition payment at local schools. Encourage communication between the student and the first host family and Rotarian counselor before the studentâ€™s arrival to establish a connection with these two critical resources and ease the transition once the student arrives.
