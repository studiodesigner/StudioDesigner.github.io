# Selecting the Rotarian Counselor



The Rotarian counselor is critical to the success of an exchange. When assigning exchange students to a counselor consider:

* Gender — Assign counselors of the same gender identification  as students when possible. If a student has a counselor of a different gender identification, assign a person of the same gender identification \(either Rotarian or non-Rotarian\) as an additional resource person.
* Time commitment — Assess how many students one counselor can effectively supervise.

  Learn more about the profile and responsibilities of Rotarian counselors in [chapter 3](../3.-building-a-successful-youth-exchange-program/).
