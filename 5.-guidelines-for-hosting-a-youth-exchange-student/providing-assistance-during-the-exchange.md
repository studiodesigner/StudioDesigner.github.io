# Providing Assistance During the Exchange

Throughout the exchange, the Rotarian counselor and members of the host club should communicate regularly with the student, make any necessary financial arrangements, such as the student’s monthly allowance and emergency fund, and facilitate the transition from one host family to the next.

The Rotarian counselor should be available to the student at all times to discuss questions or concerns about the host family or the school. Find  
 a place to talk about such issues away from the host family. In addition  
 to responding to calls from the student, the Rotarian counselor should initiate communication with the student at least once a month by phone or in-person. The counselor or another qualified Rotarian should visit the student in the host family’s home to make sure living arrangements are consistent with what was agreed upon during the screening.

Invite students to cultural and social gatherings. Whether a music lesson, a museum tour, or just meeting for a cup of coffee or tea, taking time early on to build a strong relationship with the student can make it easier to identify and manage problems later on. Continue to support the student’s assimilation as needed to help the student cope with specific cultural issues. Work with the community and the student’s school to get the student involved in positive activities and community life.

### TRANSITIONING TO NEW HOST FAMILIES

Host clubs and Rotarian counselors should help students make the transition from one host family to the next. To make this process as smooth as possible:

* Give the student advance notice, including an exact date for the move. If possible, arrange for the student to meet the family and visit their home before the move.
* Provide the new host family’s contact information to the student and the student’s parents or legal guardians before the move.
* Help the student move all belongings to the new home and get acquainted with the host family.
