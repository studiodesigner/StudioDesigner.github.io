# Rotary Club

The Youth Exchange program depends on Rotary clubs, Rotarians and their families, and the community to make local arrangements and build an effective support system for sending and hosting students. All clubs are encouraged, but not required, to participate in Youth Exchange. Club members can participate in Youth Exchange activities, either as a member of their club’s Youth Exchange committee, a host parent, or a Rotarian counselor.

## CLUB PRESIDENT

The club president appoints the club Youth Exchange chair, who should be someone with previous Youth Exchange experience. The president also oversees the selection of the club committee and supports the club’s Youth Exchange activities.

## CLUB YOUTH EXCHANGE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE

The club Youth Exchange chair plans, implements, and supports all activities involving sending and hosting long- and short-term exchange students.

The club Youth Exchange committee provides support as directed by the chair. The size and scope of this committee will vary according to the size of the club and the extent of its involvement in the program.

##  ROTARIAN COUNSELOR

Serving as liaison between the student, Rotary club, host family, and community at large, the Rotarian counselor plays a crucial role in the success of the Youth Exchange program. The counselor serves as the student’s primary Rotary contact, easing the student’s transition into the country and the community through regular personal contact throughout the year. A Rotarian counselor must be assigned to every outbound and inbound Youth Exchange student. A Rotarian counselor for outbound students helps prepare for departure and provides support with their return. The responsibilities listed below refer to a Rotarian counselor in the club hosting the exchange student.

**COUNSELOR PROFILE**

Counselors must be assigned to every outbound and inbound student in all exchange programs. The counselor should enjoy working with young people, be an advocate for the student, and be trained to respond to problems or concerns that may arise during the exchange, including allegations of abuse or harassment.

The counselor should identify as the same gender as the participant. Members of a student’s host family are not eligible to be their counselor. The Rotarian counselor should not be a close friend or relative of other volunteers involved with the exchange student, or have authority over the exchange, such as a school principal or Youth Exchange chair.
