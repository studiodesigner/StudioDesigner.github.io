# District Governor

District governors are responsible for supervising and controlling district programs, including all Youth Exchange activities. They should be familiar with program guidelines and ensure compliance with certification requirements. Governors have authority over district appointments.

Responsibilities:

* Appoint a district Youth Exchange chair and committee.
* Support and monitor club and district Youth Exchange programs to ensure activities are conducted appropriately.
* Address any problems that arise and communicate with governors in other districts on behalf of a club or district chair, as needed.
* If necessary, intervene directly to administer the program, even if responsibilities have been delegated to other district and club officers.
