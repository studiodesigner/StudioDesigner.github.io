# Youth Protection Officer



RI recommends appointing a district youth protection officer to foster safe environments across all youth programs. This person should have professional experience in handling abuse and harassment issues, be aware of RI policies, and be familiar with relevant local and national laws. More information about Rotary Internationalâ€™s youth protection policies can be found in the Rotary Youth Protection Guide.

Responsibilities:

* Maintain records of all allegations and individuals who are

  prohibited from participating in a Rotary youth program.

* Protect all parties involved, and make sure allegations are properly

  handled according to local laws and district policy.

* Work with the district and clubs to inform all Rotarians of their

  obligations under both district policy and local laws.

* Review and maintain an archive of all screened volunteers,

  including applications, criminal background checks, and reference checks, in compliance with local laws. Alternatively, serve as a liaison to an external firm contracted for this purpose.

* Advise the district youth program committees about developments in youth protection-related educational and training programs.

If a district youth protection officer is not appointed, a member of the Youth Exchange committee should be designated for maintaining youth protection policies and procedures for the Youth Exchange program.

**EFFECTIVE APPOINTMENTS AND SUCCESSION PLANNING**  
Governors are encouraged not to change more than 50 percent of the Youth Exchange committee at any time to promote continuity. They are also advised to place the governor-elect or governor-nominee on the Youth Exchange committee so the individual can become more familiar with the program.

The RI Board of Directors advocates a three-year limit on the length of service of any one chair. However, because of the specific knowledge and experience required to administer the Youth Exchange program, that limit is sometimes extended to allow time to properly train a successor. A training plan for incoming chairs that includes shadowing and mentoring can lead to a successful transition.
