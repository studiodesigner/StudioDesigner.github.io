# District Youth Exchange Chair and Committee

The Youth Exchange district chair manages Youth Exchange activities within the district and communicates with Rotary International, the district governor, and clubs. In consultation with the district governor, the chair often appoints the district committee and defines specific responsibilities for each member. Here are district committee member responsibilities:

## SETTING PROGRAM GUIDELINES

Develop district program guidelines and rules for students that comply with RI policy, including:

* Behavioral expectations
* Protocols for addressing problems
* Process for approving student travel requests

**YOUTH EXCHANGE FINANCES**  
The governor and district finance committee should oversee the Youth Exchange funds. Youth Exchange funds must be held separately from other district funds and be used only for Youth Exchange activities. Signatories can include the Youth Exchange chair, a member of the district finance committee, or a designated proxy. Some districts choose to have separate Youth Exchange bank accounts or to include Youth Exchange finances in the main district bank account as a separate line item or fund designation in order to delineate between funds.

Hosting districts or clubs should provide a monthly allowance for the student in an amount determined by the sending and hosting districts. The allowance should cover meals eaten outside of the host family’s home and public transportation costs. The district Youth Exchange committee must submit an annual budget to the governor and district finance committee for approval. The district Youth Exchange committee and district treasurer must prepare a semiannual financial report to the governor on the program.
